<h1>The Old Woman</h1>

<p>There was an old woman who swallowed a cow</p>

<script>
why("cow","goat");
why("goat","dog");
why("dog","cat");
</script>
<h2>Long poem isn't it</h2>
<script>
why("cat","bird");
why("bird","spider");
why("spider","fly");
why("pig", "crocodile");
</script>

<p>I don't know why she swallowed the fly; perhaps she'll die.</p>
