<p>Technology Goals: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1er18-oP0UGyIlmuwmSrMh0ZiSeGuOeiCiN8j5CbIZxQ">Chrome Developer Tools, Text editor.</a></p>



<h3>Class #2 & Exercises for #3</h3>
<h4>Technology Goals: </h4>
Git and GitHub. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1er18-oP0UGyIlmuwmSrMh0ZiSeGuOeiCiN8j5CbIZxQ/edit">Class Instructions Here, especially yellow-highlighted.</a>
<br/> (Solidify Chrome Developer Tools.)

<h4>Learning & Practice Goals (begin):</h4>
<p>Templates and images are <a href="class/exercise01.tgz">here</a> or just grab your own.
<ul>
<li>Create html documents, with text, headers, links and images. <a href="class/class02-basic-html/bas-02-02-html/sunflowers.html">Sunflower Example</a>. Or <a href="class/class02-basic-html/bas-02-02-html/html02.html">Van Gogh without image,</a> and then <a href="class/class02-basic-html/bas-02-02-html/sunflowers01.html">add an image</a>. Create two html docs and link them together. At some point, link to your pair-programming partner's page.
<li>Add images. Add at least 4. Include some on your own server, and link to your pair-programming partner.
<li>Basic css styling.
<ol>
<li>Choose your image size
<li>Change something stylistic (font, color)
<li>Change something format-oriented (create columns with floats. Use padding and margins)
</ol>
</ul>
<p>Get as far as you can get. If you get stuck, just copy an example and keep going. If you find it too easy, make it look good, work on UI/UX!


<h3>Class #3: Proficiency with Everything Basic Before Coding</h3>

Start class by getting GitHub and your text editor (Sublime?) set up. Then download some sample html <a href="class/exercise01.tgz">html exercise #1</a> and <a href="class/exercise02.tgz">html exercise #2</a>, and practice during lectures.

<h4>Technology Goals: </h4>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1evdQHQz4VVAh52IIQnHeJramABqYvEp_xMZvH3gbfVo/edit#slide=id.p11">Networking: what is the internet, how to get a web page.</a> Proficiency with GitHub, understanding basics of how the web is wired together.
<br/>Chrome tools: edit in place to experiment

<h4>Learning & Practice Goals:</h4>
Basic website creation -- start your project! Gather photos, start structuring
them, decide how many pages you want, create stub pages and link them.
Preferred goals: (a) display images at size and location of your choice, (b) link to your pair-programming partner's website.

<p>The intention is to create a page with small photos that expand (using scripts in the next class) and/or that are in a slider.

<h4>Resources</h4>
<ul><li>Review powerpoints from class #2. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EbPF5VqdGXhzI_uGVXBhIXGTkMXZ8pd0stCu31QkbcQ/edit">Class goals</a> and especially <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j7xB1QSjzQQOXidviWt2gmEjCSpjeiTakAqAGAqQcp4/edit#slide=id.g666c9bff5_0_36">CSS basics</a> or this take on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gQEgGurY7uawtfUrh4Q_xK-P7ZYu16VKkaNG4Sbdtq8/edit#slide=id.p16">same subject</a>.

</ul>


<h4>Break</h4>

<p>Review websites and problems specific for this class. After break, students interested in Wordpress or similar are encouraged to dive into that, and finish the exercises as homework.

<h4>[Lecture] Command Line Mention</h4>

I'm creating this like your pages. I just wrote a bad link to the screenshots, and fixed it. You can see this at GitHub.com, or if you cloned my project (StephenCataldo.github.io) you could see it in GitHub for Desktop. I used an absolute link on my computer, then posted it to the web. Now it's relative.

<p><a href="https://github.com/StephenCataldo/StephenCataldo.github.io/commit/81b10355b7e6f2aba476bac091ac9684bf8f456b">https://github.com/StephenCataldo/StephenCataldo.github.io/commit/81b10355b7e6f2aba476bac091ac9684bf8f456b</a>

<h4>Javascript for next week</h4>


<p>If we have time, we're going look at the first <a href="/class/Class %233 Scripting and Git/code/example-01-javascript-toys.html">simple script.</a>


<h3>Class #4: Basic Coding</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="class/class3.tgz">Download Class #3 Scripting and Git</a> Put it in your web folder. Play with it during lecture. The during-lecture [first hour] project is to modify the third example. Imagine this is a script you found on the web, and it does almost what you need it to do. But you (or your client) need the script to go 2 at a time. <br/>Hint: this script uses '++' which is a shortcut. You'll need to expand this script a bit, doing this in separate steps.

<h3>Class #5. Frameworks & Libraries: jQuery, Grids and Bootstrap</h3>

<div style="float: right; width: 40%;">
<h4>Aside: relative and absolute links</h4>
<p>All these links work sometimes. Some break sometimes.
<ul>
<li><a title="Works on my laptop... but makes no sense online" href="file:///Users/cataldo/StephenCataldo.github.io/bootstrap.html">file:///Users/cataldo/StephenCataldo.github.io/bootstrap.html</a>
<li><a title="Works online ... but on my laptop I don't see my work in progress, and if I change servers, I'm lost" href="http://StephenCataldo.github.io/bootstrap.html">StephenCataldo.github.io/bootstrap.html</a>

<li><a title="Works: Starts at the top of you server folder. Doesn't work on my computer. Subtle difference that often matters on a CMS." href="/bootstrap.html">/bootstrap.html</a>
<li><a title="Start where this html page is, whether on a laptop, or any server I upload my website to." href="bootstrap.html">bootstrap.html</a>.  Same as <a title="Link is relative to the server" href="./bootstrap.html">./bootstrap.html</a> where that first dot means "the folder where I already am, or inside the folder that this html document is inside."
</ul>
</div>

<p>Most of the information is in the slides, and the examples given with the
slides. We'll use online examples rather than downloading examples.</p>

<p>See basic examples of <a href="basic_examples.html">jquery sliders and other toys</a> and a very simple <a href="bootstrap.html">bootstrap example</a></p>

<p>Grids join floats and relative positioning, as ways to move content
around your page. They are not fundamental to css: they are built with css and javascript, for you to use. jQuery is a javascript library full of shortcuts.
Bootstrap is a set of css and javascript that let you create a themed
website without doing all the work yourself.</p>

<p>Today is mostly for working on your class projects. Get Sublime, load/pull/clone/[keep using] the most recent commit of your project, and experiment with
grids and javascript tools that have been built for you.
